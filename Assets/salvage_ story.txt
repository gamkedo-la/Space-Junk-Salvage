Setting / plot:

Old abandoned space ship in a salvage yard. Player character is a salvager and has a metal cutting tool that they use as a sword in the game. Ship is an old military ship with robot soldiers on it that are supposed to be deactivated but are on and malfunctioning. Player has to shut them off and salvage the computer core.

Item descriptions:

Gold key: A key, used to open doors to other rooms (or extra-dimensional spaces; currently out of service). It's gold, because shiny things are important. 

It trembles with your touch.

Salvager - Player's sword: 

Your lost friend, a metal cutting tool in it's previous life. Now a sword, and it's happy to be one. 
Use this to massacre your enemies, and start your rite towards enlightment – as one normally does.

Archaic Computer:

A computer from the times of the ancient. A time so far, far away and unknowable to you, and your history is poor — or so the computer says as you boot it up.
A strange message, and an even stranger noise emits from it. You'd be best to keep your distance away from it, something doesn't feel right...

Health Potion:
Green things are good, except when they're poison. This one should be fine, though. Drink to restore health.


Intro:
(Story Notes:  An abstract tone, and centering the story around the MC, imagining this place to be lonely and desolate and getting into the MC's psyche.)


Player:
What is it that you do when you're met with an overwhelming feeling of nothingness?
(the player is talking to themselves, or an entity depending on the player's interpretation)

Entity:..

Player:
You're asking me the same question?
Hey come on now, that's not fair. I asked you first.

Entity:..

Player:
Alright, alright, fine.
Well, I salvage things.

Entity:..

Player:
Don't look at me like that. It's the only thing I know to do best.

Entity:..

Player:
No, I don't think that what I'm doing is particularly helping anyone, and no I haven't read Shakespeare yet.
What is up with these questions? I've come so far only to be met by these shades of grey, and these questions.
I think I'm losing it. Better go pick up my salvager and do what I've come here to finish.



Intro Boss battle:
//The player and the Boss know each other. The player does not remember this, but when they walk into the boss room, it seems another person takes over (the one who remembers) and the player has no other option and uses violence. Tried to turn the narrative over to make the player the antagonist this time around. The writing in brackets indicates the players internal thoughts which are not said aloud.

'Candy' over here symbolises a yearning for innocence and old times, which could be hinted at the boss outro and end of game


//While interacting with the door that leads to the boss room
DO NoT Enter without CANDY?

Player:

(What in the world?)

Am I imagining things? 
This is stupid, I'm entering regardless.

(After entering)
Boss:

Hello there.

Player:

Hello.

Boss:
You seem to have expected me.

Player:
Yes. I remember you.
(Wait what? This isn't me saying this. I-I the words aren't mine... I am not speaking these words.)

Boss:
Have you brought the 'Candy'?

Player:
Yes.
(It feels so real... it feels distinctly me. I AM saying these words)

There's a cost to it, unfortunately. 
I can see that you have witnessed quite much... my dear old friend.
Why is it that we parted ways in the first place?

(I have this connection with 'it'. I know 'it', it's someone close...)
I hold a great deal of remorse.

Boss:
WHerE is THe CanDy? You have none.

Player:
I need to exterminate this ungodly, broken sight.
May you find your redemption in another plane.
Before I slay you, tell me, where you the one speaking to me in the beginning?

Boss:
I do not want to fight you.

Player:
I do. Save your breath. You'll need it, for now—
My thirst must be quenched.
(Please... why is this happening. I do not want to fight either.)

Boss:
So be it, my dear old friend. I'm sorry I did this.
I hope do find my candy.

Player:
Hmph.
(Did what?)
