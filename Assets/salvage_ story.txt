Setting / plot:

Old abandoned space ship in a salvage yard. Player character is a salvager and has a metal cutting tool that they use as a sword in the game. Ship is an old military ship with robot soldiers on it that are supposed to be deactivated but are on and malfunctioning. Player has to shut them off and salvage the computer core.

Item descriptions:

Gold key: A key, used to open doors to other rooms (or extra-dimensional spaces; currently out of service). It's gold, because shiny things are important. 

It trembles with your touch.

Salvager - Player's sword: 

Your lost friend, a metal cutting tool in it's previous life. Now a sword, and it's happy to be one. 
Use this to massacre your enemies, and start your rite towards enlightment – as one normally does.

Archaic Computer:

A computer from the times of the ancient. A time so far, far away and unknowable to you, and your history is poor — or so the computer says as you boot it up.
A strange message, and an even stranger noise emits from it. You'd be best to keep your distance away from it, something doesn't feel right...

Health Potion:
Green things are good, except when they're poison. This one should be fine, though. Drink to restore health.


Intro:
(Story Notes:  An abstract tone, and centering the story around the MC, imagining this place to be lonely and desolate and getting into the MC's psyche.)


Player:
What is it that you do when you're met with an overwhelming feeling of nothingness?
(the player is talking to themselves, or an entity depending on the player's interpretation)

Entity:..

Player:
You're asking me the same question?
Hey come on now, that's not fair. I asked you first.

Entity:..

Player:
Alright, alright, fine.
Well, I salvage things.

Entity:..

Player:
Don't look at me like that. It's the only thing I know to do best.

Entity:..

Player:
No, I don't think that what I'm doing is particularly helping anyone, and no I haven't read Shakespeare yet.
What is up with these questions? I've come so far only to be met by these shades of grey, and these questions.
I think I'm losing it. Better go pick up my salvager and do what I've come here to finish.
